## 🚨 Overview

**ResQNet** is an AI-powered emergency response system implementing the **Golden Triangle Emergency Model** - a comprehensive solution designed to save lives through intelligent incident management, rapid resource allocation, and real-time coordination.

Built for the **Microsoft Imagine Cup**, ResQNet bridges the gap between civilians, emergency responders, and healthcare facilities through cutting-edge technology and intelligent automation.

## 🎯 Mission

To create a unified emergency response ecosystem that reduces response times, optimizes resource allocation, and saves lives through intelligent automation and real-time coordination.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔴 Core Capabilities
- **Real-time Incident Reporting** - Citizens can report emergencies instantly with location tracking
- **Intelligent Dispatch System** - AI-powered resource allocation and routing
- **Multi-Agency Coordination** - Seamless collaboration between police, fire, and medical services
- **Live Tracking** - Real-time monitoring of emergency responders and resources
- **Predictive Analytics** - AI/ML models for hotspot prediction and resource optimization

### 🏥 Golden Triangle Model
1. **Citizens** - Easy emergency reporting and real-time updates
2. **Emergency Responders** - Coordinated dispatch and navigation
3. **Healthcare Facilities** - ICU availability and patient routing
